# Google Workspaces Alternative Application

## Project summary

The Google Workspaces Alternative Application is a communicative platform designed for Wahkiakum School district, Naselle School district, and Wahkiakum 4-H. The purpose of this application is to help faculty and students in classrooms, clubs and groups communicate with each other in a forum-like structure. It will be designed to have a coordinated User Interface to allow for fluid student collaboration while letting faculty monitor their student's behavior. 

### Additional information about the project

In today's information age, our communication is dominated by digital computer applications such as Discord, Zoom and much more. Wahkiakum School district and Naselle School district also used these applications for streamlined collaboration with instant messaging, VoIP, and file transfers. However, these applications are not supervisable and CIPA compliant which is violation with the district's regulations. It is Team Toto's mission to design this application in the interests of Wahkiakum School district and Naselle School district. It is within our hope that this application fulfills the district's needs and that application can be used and further developed for other school districts as well. 

It also worthy to note that half of the student's own smartphone, but they all have their own Chromebooks supplied to them by the school.
