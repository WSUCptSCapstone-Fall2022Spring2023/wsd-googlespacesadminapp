# Sprint 1 Report (8/26/2022 - 10/09/2022)

## What's New (User Facing)
 * Project Description, Requirements and Specifications, and Solution Approach documents
 * README.md
 * Flutter Framework skeleton code

## Work Summary (Developer Facing)
Our team initialized our project with most of our work revolving around documentation. These documents include the Project Description, Requirements and Specifications, and Solution Approach. We ran into some issues with deciding which platform to go forward with, but ultimately decided the best solution would be to build our own application from scratch. After making that decision, we were able to plan out our project effectively. In terms of building the application itself, we were able to initialize it with the Flutter framework to act as skeleton code. Overall, we are satisfied with the progress made in this Sprint and have put ourselves in a position to focus more on the development of the actual application in the next Sprint.

## Unfinished Work
Our team finished all of the work we set out to complete in Sprint 1.
