# Sprint 7 Report (4/2/2023 - 5/2/2023)

## What's New (User Facing)
* MVP Project Report Final 
* Front-end improvement
* Admin control settings
* Space settings
* User settings
* Quality of life improvements
* Mobile View Configuration

## Work Summary (Developer Facing)
In this sprint, the team has made significant progress towards the MVP Project Report, UI improvements, Spaces settings, Admin control settings and Mobile View Configuration. In Spaces, Admin users are now able to invite and kick users from the space. They can also copy the comment/post history of users into their clipboard. Spaces can now be set to public or private and the User interface for inviting and kicking users has been fixed. The home page for the application has been updated to be more user friendly. The application has been configured to work on mobile devices, but will still need some work if we continue to develop for multiple platforms. So far we have opted to developing the application to be a web app for easier access across all devices. So far, the team has met all of the client's requirements and finishing touches are being made to the application.

## Unfinished Work
Next, we will be focusing on implementing a User Manual within the Personal Settings tab and implementing more quality of life improvements.
