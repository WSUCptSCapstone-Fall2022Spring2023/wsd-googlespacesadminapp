## Work Summary (Developer Facing)
In this sprint, the team has made signifcant progress towards UI updates, profiles picture configurations, and Chromebook configurations for testing. Since the last sprint, we have been in consistent contact with our mentor Ron and Paul the school's IT director to gain access to the school's Chromebook. We have also changed the application name to "Mules" and changed the color scheme to red & black/white. Posting to Spaces has now been implemented, as well as adding descriptions. In addtion, we have added a profile picture feature and customization using the "Fluttermoji" package. We have also completed implementing the chat feature allowing users inthe same Space to message each other.
